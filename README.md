30 Python Projects Portfolio
This repository is part of my personal project to build 30 Python projects from scratch. The goal is to practice programming, develop practical skills, and create a portfolio that showcases my capabilities in data analysis and digital marketing.

As a beginner, I’m still learning Python, and these projects will help me improve step by step. Each project is crafted based on my own interests, career goals, and themes I find engaging, such as entertainment, storytelling, productivity, and data-driven insights.

Although I’m using AI for planning and advicing, I’m doing my own research and writing all the code myself. Every project here represents my own effort, learning, and problem-solving. The aim is to gain real-world experience and build a portfolio that demonstrates my ability to tackle challenges and work independently.

Purpose of This Portfolio
Build a strong foundation in Python programming with practical applications.

Develop technical skills in data analysis and digital marketing, including data manipulation, automation, and visualization.

Create a portfolio that can be shown to potential employers.

Learn to use tools like Git/GitHub for version control and project documentation.

This is about solving real-world problems with Python, not just creating complex tools for the sake of it.

Project Categories
The projects are organized into three levels based on complexity:

Easy
Beginner-friendly projects focused on basic Python syntax, data types, file handling, and simple logic.

Example topics:

Playlist generators

Simple utility tools

Working with CSV or text files

Medium
Projects involving external libraries (like pandas or BeautifulSoup), data manipulation, and basic automation.

Example topics:

Analyzing marketing data

Tracking keyword rankings

Building simple dashboards

Hard
More advanced projects focusing on machine learning, data pipelines, and web interfaces.

Example topics:

Recommender systems

Web dashboards

Working with APIs or large datasets

Tools and Technologies Used
As the projects evolve, I’m gradually incorporating more advanced tools:

Python: Core programming language

pandas / NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis

matplotlib / seaborn: Data visualization

BeautifulSoup: Web scraping

scikit-learn: Machine learning (for selected projects)

openpyxl / csv: Excel and CSV handling

Git & GitHub: Version control and project management

Folder Structure
Each project is contained in its own folder and includes:

A brief README.md explaining the project

The Python script(s)

Sample data or output files (if applicable)

The structure looks like this:

Learning Process & Transparency
This portfolio is a learning journey. I’m not an expert yet, but I’m actively building and improving my Python skills. Here's how I work:

AI is my guide for brainstorming, planning, and debugging, but I write all the code myself. I take the time to understand and test my work.

I don’t copy full solutions from others. If I refer to someone else's work, I give credit and adapt the idea in my own way.

I base many projects on themes I enjoy—whether it's sci-fi, K-dramas, or practical digital marketing tools. This keeps me motivated and engaged.

Future Plans
The challenge is ongoing. I’ll continue to update this repository as I finish each project. Over time, I might refactor old code, improve documentation, or add new features to projects. 
Starting point: 30 Apr 2025
